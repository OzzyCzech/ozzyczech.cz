Apps for browsing the web, managing network privacy, downloading files, reading feeds, and messaging on macOS.

## Browsers

- **[Zen](https://zen-browser.app/)** — Firefox-based browser with a focus-oriented, tab-grouping interface
- **[Brave](https://brave.com/)** — Chromium-based browser with built-in ad blocking and privacy features
- **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)** — open-source browser by Mozilla with strong privacy defaults and extension support

## Ad blockers

- **[Wipr](https://kaylees.site/wipr2.html)** — content blocker for Safari using the native Safari Extensions API

## Download managers

- **[AB Download Manager](https://abdownloadmanager.com/)** — free and open-source (Apache-2.0) desktop download manager written in Kotlin with Compose Multiplatform; a free [IDM](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) alternative that splits a file into segments and pulls them over several connections at once when the server supports range requests, plus download queues and schedulers, dark/light/black themes, and official [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ab-download-manager/) and [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ab-download-manager-brows/bbobopahenonfdgjgaleledndnnfhooj) extensions that hand downloads over from the browser; builds for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, Linux and Android. Install on macOS from the author's own tap — it is not in homebrew-cask core:

  ```shell
  brew tap amir1376/tap && brew install --cask ab-download-manager
  ```

  :::caution
  The project is not published on Google Play or other app stores. Anything claiming to be it there should be treated as fake — [download from the website or GitHub releases](https://github.com/amir1376/ab-download-manager/releases/latest).
