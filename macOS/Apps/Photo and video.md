## FFmpeg and Apple format compatibility

To export H.264 video compatible with iMovie and Apple devices, add `-pix_fmt yuv420p`:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.avi -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```

For ProRes output (supported in iMovie 10+):

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v prores -c:a pcm_s16le output.mov
```

For Apple-native workflows, prefer common MP4/MOV exports with H.264, HEVC, or Apple ProRes. Older or specialized codecs may require conversion or a third-party player.

See [Apple's media compatibility guide](https://support.apple.com/en-is/102644) for current troubleshooting guidance.
