# What are the best Fujifilm X-Mount Lenses in 2022?

## Best standard zoom lenses

The standard zoom lens is the photographer's **handy multitool** a variable lens capturing landscapes, groups, or architecture, and a telephoto to get closer to a distant subject or make a portrait.

* [XF 16-55mm F2-8 LM WR](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf16-55mmf28-r-lm-wr/) - best standard zoom lense
* You also may consider [Fujinon XF 16-80mm f/4 R OIS WR](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf16-80mmf4-r-ois-wr/) but there is notable lack in AF system that's specially in low light.

## Best wide angel lenses

Technically, wide-angle lenses are those with focal lengths shorter than a ‘normal’ lens. But what’s ‘normal’? That’s based on a diagonal measurement of the individual camera’s sensor size. On an X Series camera, normal lenses are around 28mm, so anything under 28mm is wide angle. And that includes models with focal lengths like 16mm, 18mm, 23mm, and so on.
