# What are the best Fujifilm X-Mount Lenses in 2022?

## Best standard zoom lenses

The standard zoom lens is the photographer's handy multitool—a variable lens capturing landscapes, groups, or architecture, and a telephoto to get closer to a distant subject or make a portrait.

## Best wide angel lenses

Technically, wide-angle lenses are those with focal lengths shorter than a ‘normal’ lens. But what’s ‘normal’? That’s based on a diagonal measurement of the individual camera’s sensor size. On an X Series camera, normal lenses are around 28mm, so anything under 28mm is wide angle. And that includes models with focal lengths like 16mm, 18mm, 23mm, and so on.
