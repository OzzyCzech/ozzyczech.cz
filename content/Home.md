# Welcome to my notes

The website is a public presentation of my notes collected over time. It's open sourced, you
can [found source](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz) on #GitHub - all content is maintained
by [Roman OÅ¾ana](https://ozana.cz).

## What's about?

Notes are mostly about #JavaScript , #PHP or #Tailwind and development in general. There are some #WordPress codes and
some #iot stuff. I'm trying to keep notes as short as possible. I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to
write notes and [GitHub](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz) to publish them.
