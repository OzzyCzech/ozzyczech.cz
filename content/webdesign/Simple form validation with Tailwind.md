# Simple form validation with Tailwind

Tailwind have multiple utilities for different inputs states like `required`, `invalid`, and `disabled`.
See the [pseudo-class reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states) for a complete 
list of available pseudo-class modifiers. 

But what if user just loaded website and there are `required` inputs with default (empty) value?
They will be immediately red and `invalid` - that's not what you expect!

```html
<input type="url" class="invalid:bg-red-500" value="" required />
```

You should wait with input validation to user. That's why the [CSS pseud-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-invalid) 
`:user-invalid` exists. This class represents any validated form element whose value isn't valid based on their validation constraints,
after the user has interacted with it. Right now `:user-invalid` pseudo-class isn't very well 
supported - [works only in Firefox](https://caniuse.com/?search=user-invalid).

Let's crate following Javascript (sort of polyfill):

```js
/**
 * Form validation for older browsers
 *
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-invalid
 * @see https://caniuse.com/?search=user-invalid
 */
try {
	if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
		document.querySelector(':user-invalid');
	}
} catch {
	document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
		for (const input of document.querySelectorAll('input')) {
			input.addEventListener('change', event => event.target.classList.add('dirty'));
		}
	});
}
```

This code adds a `dirty` class to all changed input fields, which helps us to *simulate* the `:user-invalid` pseudo-class and clearly mark all inputs that have been changed by the user.
Then you can easily distinguish between changed and unchanged inputs that are invalid. Following [Tailwind code](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#invalid) 
requires [tailwindcss-forms plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms):

```css
@tailwind base;

@layer base {
 [type='text'],
	[type='email'],
	[type='url'],
	[type='password'],
	[type='number'],
	[type='date'],
	[type='datetime-local'],
	[type='month'],
	[type='search'],
	[type='tel'],
	[type='time'],
	[type='week'],
	[multiple],
	textarea,
	select {
    @apply block w-full rounded-md shadow-sm;
		@apply border-gray-300 focus:border-blue-300;
		@apply dark:bg-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 dark:text-white;
		@apply placeholder-gray-500 dark:placeholder-gray-400;
		@apply dark:border-gray-600 dark:focus:border-gray-500;

		@apply focus:ring;
		@apply focus:ring-blue-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-600;
		@apply focus:ring-opacity-50 dark:focus:ring-opacity-50;
  }
}

@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* invalid and dirty or :user*/
:is(input:user-invalid, input.dirty) {
	@apply invalid:focus:ring-red-100 invalid:focus:dark:ring-red-500 invalid:focus:dark:ring-opacity-30;
	@apply invalid:dark:bg-red-800/20 invalid:dark:border-red-900;
	@apply invalid:bg-red-50 invalid:border-red-300;
}
```
