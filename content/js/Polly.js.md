[![Record, replay, and stub HTTP interactions.](/js/Polly.js.png#center)](https://netflix.github.io/pollyjs/#/)

Polly.JS is a standalone, framework-agnostic JavaScript library that enables recording, replaying, and stubbing of HTTP interactions. By tapping into multiple request APIs across both Node & the browser, Polly.JS is able to mock requests and responses with little to no configuration while giving you the ability to take full control of each request with a simple, powerful, and intuitive API.
