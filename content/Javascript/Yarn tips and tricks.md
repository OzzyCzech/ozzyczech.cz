# Yarn tips and tricks

## Chose Yarn version

Let’s find out your current Yarn version with `yarn --version`. 
If your local Yarn version is 1.22 and above go ahead and type-in:

```shell
yarn set version berry
```

This should fetch [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/) and show you an output as follows:

```
Resolving berry to a url...
Downloading https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/raw/master/packages/berry-cli/bin/berry.js...
Saving it into /Volumes/Work/web/.yarn/releases/yarn-berry.cjs...
Updating /Volumes/Work/web/.yarnrc.yml...
Done!
```

You can downgrade back with follow:

```shell
yarn set version 1.22.5
```

## Upgrade all npm packages interactively

This is similar to [npm-check interactive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-interactive) update mode. 
It provides an easy way to update outdated packages


```shell
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest 
```

Will looks like follow:

```

## Offline package mirrors

Yarn can maintain offline copies of your packages for more repeatable and reliable build.
Create `.yarnrc` file with follow content:

```yaml
yarn-offline-mirror "./.npm"
yarn-offline-mirror-pruning true
--install.prefer-offline true
--install.dev true
```

All npm packages will be saved to `.npm` folder locally.
