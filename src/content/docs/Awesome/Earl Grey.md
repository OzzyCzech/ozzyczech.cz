Earl Grey is a tea blend which has been flavoured with the addition of oil of bergamot. Bergamot is a variety of
orange that is often grown in Italy and France. The rind's fragrant oil is added to black tea to give Earl Grey
its unique taste. Traditionally, Earl Grey was made from black teas such as China keemun and therefore intended
to be drunk without milk. However, tea companies have since begun to offer Earl Grey based upon stronger teas
such as Ceylons which are better suited to the addition of milk or cream. Earl Grey is the most popular
flavoured tea, and is enjoyed by millions all over the world.
