title: Gettings Real - heighlights
---

## Starting

> When there's too many people involved, nothing gets done.

> Many months are spent on planning features and arguing details with the goal
> of everyone reaching an agreement on what is the "right" thing for the
> customer.

> Months of writing specs are not necessary — specs should have the foundations
> nailed and details figured out and refined during the development phase.

> Getting Real is about skipping all the stuff that represents real (charts,
> graphs, boxes, arrows, schematics, wireframes, etc.) and actually building the
> real thing.

> Getting Real foregoes functional specs and other transitory documentation in
> favor of building real screens.

> Getting Real gets rid of... Timelines that take months or even years
> Pie-in-the-sky functional specs Scalability debates Interminable staff
> meetings The "need" to hire dozens of employees Meaningless version numbers
> Pristine roadmaps that predict the perfect future Endless preference options
> Outsourced support Unrealistic user testing Useless paperwork Top-down
> hierarchy You don't need tons of money or a huge team or a lengthy development
> cycle to build great software. Those things are the ingredients for slow,
> murky, changeless applications. Getting real takes the opposite approach.

## Change

> The ability to change is key. Having everything fixed makes it tough to
> change.

> If your competition is faster, you must be cheaper. If they sell the story of
> health, you must sell the story of convenience.

> A lot of small companies make the mistake of trying to act big.

> Mass is increased by... Long term contracts Excess staff Permanent decisions
> Meetings about other meetings Thick process Inventory (physical or mental)
> Hardware, software, technology lock-ins Proprietary data formats The past
> ruling the future Long-term roadmaps Office politics

> Change is your best friend.

> If change gets too expensive, you're dead.

> When it comes to web technology, change must be easy and cheap.

> Ignore Details Early On Work from large to small

> Don't worry about the size of your headline font in week one. You don't need
> to nail that perfect shade of green in week two. You don't need to move that
> "submit" button three pixels to the right in week three. Just get the stuff on
> the page for now. Then use it. Make sure it works.

## New features

> Believe it or not, the bigger problem isn't scaling, it's getting to the point
> where you have to scale. Without the first problem you won't have the second.

> Organizations need guideposts. They need an outline; employees need to know
> each day when they wake up why they're going to work.

> Take whatever you think your product should be and cut it in half. Pare
> features down until you're left with only the most essential ones.

> For every new feature you need to...
>
> 1. Say no.
> 2. Force the feature to prove its value.
> 3. If "no" again, end here. If "yes," continue...
> 4. Sketch the screen(s)/ui.
> 5. Design the screen(s)/ui.
> 6. Code it. 7-15. Test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak...
> 7. Check to see if help text needs to be modified.
> 8. Update the product tour (if necessary).
> 9. Update the marketing copy (if necessary).
> 10. Update the terms of service (if necessary).
> 11. Check to see if any promises were broken.
> 12. Check to see if pricing structure is affected.
> 13. Launch.
> 14. Hold breath.

> Ask people what they don't want

> Innovation comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on
> the wrong track or try to do too much.

> Most of the time you spend is wasted on things that just don't matter. If you
> can cut out the work and thinking that just don't matter, you'll achieve
> productivity you've never imagined.

> It is simply too easy, and sometimes fun, to waste valuable time inventing
> features that turn out to be unnecessary or unimplementable.

## Environment and hires

> Guess which part of the day we get the most work done? The alone part. It's
> not that surprising really. Many people prefer to work either early in the
> morning or late at night — times when they're not being bothered.

> The alone zone is where real progress is made.

> Getting in the zone takes time. And that's why interruption is your enemy.
> It's like rem sleep — you don't just go to rem sleep, you go to sleep first
> and you make your way to rem. Any interruptions force you to start over. rem
> is where the real sleep magic happens. The alone time zone is where the real
> development magic happens.

> They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute

> Judge potential tech hires on open source contributions

> A single good programmer working on a single task has no coordination or
> communication overhead. Five programmers working on the same task must
> coordinate and communicate. That takes a lot of time... The real trouble with
> using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that
> no matter how long they work, they never produce something as good as what the
> great programmers can produce.

> Enthusiasm. It's one attribute you just can't fake.

> Someone you can trust to get things done when left alone.

> At Creative Good, we call it "intelligent inconsistency": making sure that
> each page in the process gives users exactly what they need at that point in
> the process.

## Design

> Copywriting is interface design.

> Whatever the page absolutely can't live without is the epicenter.

> Only when that unit is complete would you begin to think about the second most
> critical element on the page. Then after the second most critical element,
> you'd move on to the third, and so on. That's epicenter design.

> Epicenter design flips that process and allows you to focus on what really
> matters on day one. Essentials first, extras second.

> "Defensive Design for the Web" Remember: Your app may work great 90% of the
> time. But if you abandon customers in their time of need, they're unlikely to
> forget it.

> To avoid crappy-admin-screen syndrome, don't build separate screens to deal
> with admin functions. Instead, build these functions (i.e. edit, add, delete)
> into the regular application interface.

> Much like a weblog, it's up to them to populate it — the overall look and feel
> doesn't take shape until people enter their data: posts, links, comments,
> hours, sidebar info, or whatever.

> Use it as an opportunity to insert quick tutorials and help blurbs. Give a
> sample screenshot of the page populated with data so people know what to
> expect (and why they should stick around). Explain how to get started, what
> the screen will eventually look like, etc. Answer key questions that
> first-time viewers will ask: What is this page? What do I do now? How will
> this screen look once it's full? Set expectations and help reduce frustration,
> intimidation, and overall confusion.

> You Never Get A Second Chance...

> Is a new feature requiring weeks of time and thousands of lines of code?
> That's your code telling you there's probably a better way.

> **If programmers got paid to remove code from sofware instead of writing new
> code, software would be a whole lot better.**

> Keep your code as simple as possibe each time you increase the amount of code,
> your software grows exponentially more complicated. Each minor addition, each
> change, each interdependency, and each preference has a cascading effect.

> The way you fight this complexity is with less software. Less software means
> less features, less code, less waste.

> Less software is easier to manage. Less software reduces your codebase and
> that means less maintenance busywork (and a happier staff). Less software
> lowers your cost of change so you can adapt quickly. You can change your mind
> without having to change boatloads of code. Less software results in fewer
> bugs. Less software means less support.

> **Tere is No CODE That is More Flexible Than NO Code!**

> Don't try to lock-in your customers. Let them get their information when they
> want it and how they want it.

## Motivating

> Optimize for Happiness Choose tools that keep your team excited and motivated

> Would you truly be happy working in this environment eight hours a day?

> Happiness has a cascading effect. Happy programmers do the right thing. They
> write simple, readable code. They take clean, expressive, readable, elegant
> approaches. They have fun.

> Don't Do Dead Documents Eliminate unnecessary paperwork

> Documents that live separately from your application are worthless.

> Documents that live separately from your application are worthless. They don't
> get you anywhere.

> Don't waste your time typing up that long visionary tome; no one's going to
> read it.

> I've even worked with developers who've spent hours writing long, descriptive
> emails or coding standards documents that also went unread.

## Documenting

> **Functional specs are fantasies!**

> There's Nothing Functional about a Functional Spec Don't write a functional
> specifications document

> Functional specs lead to feature overload

> Write a one page story about what the app needs to do. Use plain language and
> make it quick. If it takes more than a page to explain it, then it's too
> complex.

> A "spec" is close to useless. I have never seen a spec that was both big
> enough to be useful and accurate. And I have seen lots of total crap work that
> was based on specs. It's the single worst way to write software, because it by
> definition means that the software was written to match theory, not reality.

> Use Real Words Insert actual text instead of lorem ipsum

> **Easy On, Easy Off Make signup and cancellation a painless process**

> There should always be a free option so customers can demo the app without
> entering credit card information.

> Keep the signup form as short as possible. Don't ask for stuff you don't need
> and don't throw a long daunting form at people.

> Don't hold users against their will. If they want to leave, let them pick up
> with all of the content they created while they were on your site and
> leave...for free...

> Ask them if they want to be included on your special advance list so they'll
> be among the first to know about future releases, updates, etc. Collect
> positive praise and create a "buzz" page at your site.

> During business hours, we answer 90% of all email support requests within 90
> minutes — and often within a half-hour. And people love it.

> You don't need a manual to use Yahoo or Google or Amazon. So why can't you
> build a product that doesn't require a manual? Strive to build a tool that
> requires zero training.

> Just because you discover a bug in your product, doesn't mean it's time to
> panic. All software has bugs — it's just a fact of life.

> These days it feels like everything is in beta stage forever. That's a cop
> out. An interminable beta stage tells customers you're not really committed to
> rolling out a finished product. It says, "Use this, but if it's not perfect,
> it's not our fault."

## Betas

> **Private betas are fine, public betas are bullshit.**

> Don't wait for your product to reach perfection.

> Is it just me, or are we all in beta, all the time?

> Sometimes it's ok to just be a pencil. You don't need to be a swiss-army
> knife.

> With web-based software based on the subscription model, people pay a monthly
> fee to use the service. You don't need to keep upselling them by adding more
> and more and more, you just need to provide an ongoing valuable service.
