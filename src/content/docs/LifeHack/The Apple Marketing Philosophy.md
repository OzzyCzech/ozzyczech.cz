# The Apple Marketing Philosophy

### Empathy

We will truly understand their needs better than any other company.

### Focus

In order to do a good job of those things we decide to do we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.

### Impute

People **DO** judge a book by its cover.  
We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; 
if we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; 
if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will *impute* 
the desired qualities.
