title: Document write replacement
---

Replacement of `document.write` can be combination of [insertAdjacentHTML()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML) method and [document.currentScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/currentScript) property.

The `insertAdjacentHTML()` method of the Element interface parses the specified text as HTML or XML and inserts the resulting nodes into the DOM tree at a **specified position**: 

 - `beforebegin`: Before the element itself.
 - `afterbegin`: Just inside the element, before its first child.
 - `beforeend`: Just inside the element, after its last child.
 - `afterend`: After the element itself.

The `Document.currentScript` property returns the `<script>` element whose script is currently being processed. Best position to add new HTML will be **beforebegin** - new HTML will be inserted before `<script>` itself.

```html
<script>
  document.currentScript.insertAdjacentHTML(
    'beforebegin', 
    'this is the document.write alternative'
  );
</script>
```
