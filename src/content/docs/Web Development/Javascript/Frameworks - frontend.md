A curated list of **frontend** JavaScript frameworks: UI libraries, full-stack frameworks, and tools for the browser.

## React ecosystem

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** — Library for building user interfaces with components and a large ecosystem.
- **[Preact](https://preactjs.com/)** — Small (~3 kB) alternative to React with the same modern API.
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** — React framework with server rendering, static export, and file-based routing.

## Vue ecosystem

- **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)** — Progressive framework for UIs: use as a library or scale up with tooling.
- **[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)** — Vue framework for full-stack apps, SSG, and SSR with great DX.

## Svelte

- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)** — Compiler-first framework: you write components, it outputs small, fast JavaScript that updates the DOM directly (no virtual DOM).

## Angular

- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** — Full platform for building single-page apps with TypeScript, CLI, and built-in routing/state.

## Other frontend frameworks

- **[Remix](https://remix.run/)** — Full-stack React framework focused on web standards, fast loads, and great UX.
