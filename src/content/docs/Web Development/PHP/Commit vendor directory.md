description: How to safely commit composer vendor directory to the git repository.

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is great tool, but sometimes you will need avoid all external dependencies.
Sometimes you will need have all source codes in your git repository. Should I [ commit the dependencies](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md)
in my vendor directory, and still have all benefits of using Composer? Here are my requirements: -
Everything need to be automatically.

- I will work on application and my packages together.
- I need a simple way how to commit and publish new version of packages.
- Workflow need to be simple (mimimum of commands)

### How to commit vendor dir?

Remove `vendor` dir from your `.gitignore` and add follow lines to root of `composer.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "echo [WARNING] Delete all .git dirs",
      "rm -rf vendor/**/**/.git"
    ],
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "echo [WARNING] Delete all .git dirs",
      "rm -rf vendor/**/**/.git"
    ]
  }
}
```

That's automatically remove the `.git` directory of every dependency after the installation or update.
You can safely commit everything to your git repo and avoid mistakes with fake
git "submodules". Run: `composer update` and commit everything to your repo. ### How make changes in packages?

When you are using tagged releases (no dev versions) of package then run:

```shell
rm -rf vendor/some/package
composer update some/package --prefer-source --no-scripts
```

For dev versions (dev-master) it's simpler:

```shell
rm -rf vendor/some/package
composer update some/package --no-scripts
```

Now, when you go to vendor/some/package dir it's common git repository - you can make changes,
commit and publish new versions of package. But don't forget run `composer update`
before commit main repo, becouse there is still .git dir in package! ### Disadvantages

- Large VCS repository size and diffs when you update code.
- Duplication of the history of all your dependencies in your own VCS.
- There can be conflicts in commits especially when you work in larger team.
- Still **not avoid commit .git directory** after running composer with `--no-scripts` param.
