Public notes are mostly about web development and other **things I'm interested in**.
They include things I've **googled a lot** and want to remember, as well as things
I find interesting and worth sharing.

The main purpose is to have a place where **I can store my notes**.

The content is mostly based on my experience and knowledge.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Technology Stack

Website is build with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
It's worth mentioning that it used to be built with [Sphido](https://sphido.cz),
but I've decided to _move everything_ to Starlight. Focus **more on content** and less on technology.
