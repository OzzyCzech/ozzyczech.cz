This website is a public presentation of my notes collected over time.
It's [open source](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz), you can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz)
all content is maintained by [Roman Ožana](https://ozana.cz).

### What's about?

Public notes mostly about web development and other **stuff I'm interested in**.
They include things I've Googled a lot and want to remember, as well as things
I find interesting and worth sharing.

### What's the purpose?

The main goal is to have a **place where I can store my notes**.
I'm trying to keep the content **up to date and relevant**.
Content is mostly based on my experience and knowledge.

### Can I contribute?

Yes. Website is [open source](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz), you can
find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OzzyCzech/ozzyczech.cz).

### Technology stack

Website is build with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
It's worth mentioning that it used to be built with [Sphido](https://sphido.cz),
but I've decided to _move everything_ to Starlight. Focus **more on content** and less on technology.
